	<b>Log calls should be conditional:</b>
	<br><br>
	This inspection reports that the call to a log method should be wrapped inside
	an '<code>if</code>' statement that tests whether the corresponding log level is enabled for
	logging or not.
	<br><br>
	Most log frameworks support querying what levels are enabled to improve the
	overall application performance when logging is set to a <b>lower level</b>.
	The improvement is achieved by skipping String concatenation and
	other conversions related to the log call.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b>Whether the inspection reports this or not, depends on the project
	settings of the "Log Support" plugin and on the capabilities of the used log framework.
