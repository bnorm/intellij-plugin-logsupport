	<b>Verify throwable in formatted message:</b>
	<br><br>
	This inspection reports that a <code>Throwable</code> is in the argument list of
	the method call, although message formatting is applied to the log message.
	<br><br>
	Some log frameworks do not support formatting messages and handling throwables at once.
	Whether this inspection is enabled or not depends on the features of the used log framework.
