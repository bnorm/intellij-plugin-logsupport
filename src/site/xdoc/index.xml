			<p>
				TinyJEE is a zero conf, zero maintenance embeddable platform 
				that has the major goal make the usage of JEE as easy as working 
				with GRAILS while following a component oriented approach with 
				minimized dependencies and main focus on POJO and Java config.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note: If you're looking for a full blown, certified JEE 
				application server, consider using something else.
				<br/>
				TinyJEE's focus is to be simple, small and rapid development
				ready but not 100% standards compliance.
